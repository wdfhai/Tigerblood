- Bootstrap4, NodeJS, Express, REACT, MongoDB/ Mongoose
- Rot.js, CodeMirror, Mocha, Chai.

### Future Development

While we couldn't include all of the features we wanted to during our short development time, we would love to eventually enable the following features in the future:

- Sound Effects and a soundtrack,
- Different difficulty levels,
- More stages and characters,
- More intricate doorlocks and functions,
- Mobile version or compatibility,
- Checkpoints.

### Installation

### Summary

We would like to thank all of our cohort students for an amazing time spent learning with all of you. You have left us with unforgettable memories and inside jokes (some of which we have included in the ganme). A very special thanks to our masterful instructor who was there for us every step of the way, whether to answer all of our stupid question ( Michael!) or to 'console our (javascript) bugs'. One day we hope to have enough time and money to make our dream projects happen and we'll be sure to invite you to take a look :D .
